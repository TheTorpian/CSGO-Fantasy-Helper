# CSGO Fantasy Helper
CLI python script to help you build your CSGO HLTV fantasy team

## Options  
py FantasyHelper.py [-h] [-s] [-l] [-o OUTPUT]  

## Usage
First I recommend using the scrape [-s] option, so you get the players' data; this creates a file where the script was run, already formatted, ready to be copy-pasted into the script. Optionally you can limit the teams it can get players from (and some other filtering, like a whitelist and a blacklist).
